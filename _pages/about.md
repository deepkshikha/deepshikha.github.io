I am a **Professor at <a href"https://www.imt-atlantique.fr">IMT Atlantique</a>** and a research scientist at Lab-STICC in the field of **Data Science and Computational Imaging**. I am deeply involved in interdisciplinary research at the **interface between data science and ocean science**, especially space oceanography and marine ecology. My current research interests include **deep learning for dynamical systems and applicationns to the understanding, analysis, simulation and reconstruction of ocean dynamics**, especially using satellite ocean remote sensing data.
