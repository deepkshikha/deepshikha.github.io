I am deeply involved in interdisciplinary research at the <strong>interface between data science and ocean science</strong>, especially space oceanography and marine ecology. My current research interests include <strong>deep learning for dynamical systems and applicationns to the understanding, analysis, simulation and reconstruction of ocean dynamics</strong>, especially using satellite ocean remote sensing data.
