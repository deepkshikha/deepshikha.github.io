Cominlabs-LabexMer-Lebesgue SEACS (2015-2019) "Stochastic modEl-dAta-Coupled representationS for the analysis, simulation and reconstruction of upper ocean dynamics"

Summary. 
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
SEACS aims at exploring novel statistical and stochastic methods to address the emulation, reconstruction and forecast of fine-scale upper ocean dynamics. From the recent advances in the theoretical understanding, modeling and simulation of upper ocean dynamics along with the mass of data routinely available to observe the ocean evolution, our key objective is to investigate new tools and methods for the calibration and implementation of novel sound and efficient oceanic dynamical models. In this respect, the emphasis will be given to stochastic frameworks to encompass multi-scale/multi-source approaches and benefit from the available observation and simulation massive data. The addressed scientific questions constitute basic research issues at the frontiers of several disciplines. It crosses in particular advanced data analysis approaches, physical oceanography and stochastic representations. To develop such an interdisciplinary initiative, we gather a set of research groups associated with these different scientific domains, which have already proven for several years their capacities to interact and collaborate on topics related to oceanic data and models. This project will place Brittany with an innovative and leading expertise at the frontiers of Computer Science, Statistics and Oceanography. This transdisciplinary research initiative is expected to resort to significant advances challenging the current thinking in computational oceanography. It falls within the thematic priority “ICT & Environment” of Cominlabs call for proposal. </div>
