Current generation satellite altimetry missions 
have played   a   fundamental   role   in   improving   our   understanding of  sea  surface  dynamics, despite
only  being able to provide measurements along the satellite track.In this respect, the future SWOT  altimetry 
mission  will  be  the  first  mission  to  produce complete two-dimensional wide-swath satellite observations. 
With a view towards the upcoming SWOT mission launch, we explore the potential of SWOT observations to improve 
the reconstruction of  high-resolution  sea  level  anomaly  (SLA)  fields  from  satellite-derived  data.  
Given  the  ever-increasing  availability  of  multi-source  datasets  that  supports  the  exploration  of  
data-driven alternatives to classical model-driven formulations, we focus here on  recently  introduced  
data-driven  models  for  the  interpolation of  geophysical  fields.  Using  an  Observing  System  Simulation 
Experiment  (OSSE),  we  demonstrate  the  relevance  of  SWOT observations to better constraint data-driven 
interpolation models in  order  to  improve  the  reconstruction  of  mesoscale  features. Reported  results  suggest 
that  SWOT  observations  can  provide more information than currently available nadir along-track altimetry observations 
and show an additional SLA reconstruction performance improvement when the joint assimilation of SWOT and nadir along-track
observations is considered.
