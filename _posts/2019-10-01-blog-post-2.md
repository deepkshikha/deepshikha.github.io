Good news from the ANR with the newly-funded project Melody
(Bridging geophysics and MachinE Learning for the modeling, simulation and reconstruction of Ocean DYnamics), 2019-2023.
Look at this <a href="https://rfablet.github.io/projects/2019-melody">link</a> for more information. We will open 
PhD and postdoc positions within the framework of this project. Do not hesitate to contact me (ronan.fablet AT imt-atlantique.fr).
